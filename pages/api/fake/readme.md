1. maybe it makes sense to only fetch the "all" data then do all of the filtering client side, since the other tabs are just filters of all anyways. We shouldn't fetch the data 4 times when its just the same spin on the all data.

2. One reason the point above might not make sense is if we have different data on different tabs, like member list vs assets list.
