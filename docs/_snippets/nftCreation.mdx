### How NFT creation works

NFTs are represented on the blockchain through a smart contract that manages the accounting of who owns which NFT.
To create a new NFT collection, we create a new smart contract designed to manage it and then are able to populate it with the actual tokens.
The smart contract is analogous to a spreadsheet, it is the home that defines the structure and content of the records.

This API route will take in parameters for creating a new NFT collection and return an address where this new smart contract is deployed.
This contract address uniquely identifies your NFT collection and will be used in other API routes.

<Note>All tokens are created on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).</Note>
