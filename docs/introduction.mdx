## What is Station?

From day one, Station has been committed to building products that transport a 
new class of workers to participate in the crypto economy. Proposals are a 
universal expression of intent for high-commitment, high-quality contribution 
to DAOs. They are the building blocks of an organization, the same way that 
legal agreements and databases form the scaffolding of a corporation. We set out
to build a tool that empowers anybody to submit meaningful proposals and enables
organizations to seamlessly manage their talent and project pipeline.

### Problem for DAOs

<Card title="Operational inefficiency" icon="users-gear">
  Proposals often get lost in forums or Github repos. When decisions get made,
  there’s significant manual overhead to coordinate funding, decision-making,
  and communications. High-quality projects lose momentum by getting stuck in
  bureaucratic processes.
</Card>
<Card title="Lack of incentives for quality proposals" icon="sack-xmark">
  DAOs want more high-quality talent to contribute to their ecosystem, but
  there’s a lack of financial and social incentives for creating high-quality
  proposals.
</Card>
<Card title="Lack of accountability and feedback" icon="message-xmark">
  Once funds get deployed, it’s difficult to hold the projects accountable for
  their progress. This is especially true when participants want to remain
  anonymous.
</Card>

### Friction for Contributors

<Card title="Opaque path to participation" icon="scribble">
  The fragmentation of tools makes it difficult to know where it’s possible to
  create the most impact and which high-value initiatives to join.
</Card>
<Card title="High barrier to contribution" icon="road-barrier">
  To quality-control, protocols and DAOs impose high economic barriers of entry
  and political, beaurocratic processes for participation, disincentivizing
  newcomers to submit ideas and showcase their talent.
</Card>
<Card title="Lack of accountability and feedback" icon="message-xmark">
  Just as projects can take the funding and disappear, protocols can fail to
  deliver funding in time for contributors to act on their initiative.
</Card>

We're not satisfied with the ways that people and ideas get fostered in DAOs, so we strive to build something much better.
