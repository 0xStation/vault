Our token smart contracts are written in Solidity, limiting them to the EVM. We currently recommend
`polygon` for most use cases and also support `ethereum` and other EVM chains on a consulting basis.

To evaluate your network needs, [schedule a short call](https://calendly.com/symmtry/token-api) with our team.
