</Info>

To get started with a Points system, [create a new collection](/token-api/erc20/post/create).
Creating a collection will deploy a new token contract for you and return an address of this contract.

Using the NFT contract address, you can [mint tokens to your network](/token-api/erc20/post/mint).
Our blockchain indexing systems will automatically pick up these operations and organize the activity.

After distributing tokens to your network, you can [fetch all token holders of your token collections](/token-api/holders/holders)
for multi-token analysis.

<Note>All tokens are created on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).</Note>
