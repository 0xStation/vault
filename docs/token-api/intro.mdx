Station provides value infrastructure for decentralized networks. Token management is the future
of network management. As the line between contributor-ship, membership, and customers blur, networks
need flexible ways to reward, recognize, and retain stakeholders. With Station, you can programmatically
mint and distribute NFTs and ERC-20s to your users and contributors based on customized logic.

### Why Station?

- **For developers:** Set up digital-native incentive programs in minutes with developer-friendly APIs.
- **For community managers:** Make better decisions with an aggregated view of stakeholders, network ownership, and key events.
