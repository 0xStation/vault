description: "Define custom logic for automating the distribution and management of tokens."

After creating one or more tokens, leverage our Automations Kit to define behavior reward systems.
While the core Token API enables developers to trigger token operations for any arbitrary reason
from their infrastructure, Automations Kit templatizes triggers from onchain activity, reducing effort
to build fully automated linkages to other onchain systems.

To evaluate your onchain automation needs, [schedule a short call](https://calendly.com/symmtry/token-api) with our team.
