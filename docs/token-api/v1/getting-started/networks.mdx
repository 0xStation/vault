Our token smart contracts are written in Solidity, limiting them to the EVM. We currently recommend
`polygon` for most use cases and also support `ethereum` and other EVM chains on a consulting basis.

To evaluate your network needs, [schedule a short call](https://calendly.com/symmtry/chat) with our team.

Tokens are uniquely identified by the combination of their smart contract address and the network it resides,
often labeled with `contractAddress` and `chainId` repspectively. If you are uncertain about the `chainId` of
your network, refer to [this list](https://chainlist.org/).
