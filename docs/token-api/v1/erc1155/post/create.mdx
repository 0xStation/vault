### How NFT creation works

NFTs are represented on the blockchain through a smart contract that manages the accounting of who owns which NFT.
To create a new NFT collection, we create a new smart contract designed to manage it and then are able to populate it with the actual tokens.
The smart contract is analogous to a spreadsheet, it is the home that defines the structure and content of the records.

This API route will take in parameters for creating a new NFT collection and return an address where this new smart contract is deployed.
This contract address uniquely identifies your NFT collection and will be used in other API routes.

### Differences with Memberships (ERC-721)

In a Membership NFT collection, there only exists one of each specific NFT, making it unique. In a Badge NFT
collection, there can be many of each specific NFT, enabling multiple people to own the same item simultaneously.
This also enables people to own more than one copy of a Badge, supporting use cases like split ownership of
an NFT where the number of copies someone holds corresponds to capital contribution to purchase the NFT.

Signals that your use case may be better fit with a Badge versus a Membership NFT:

- **You expect many people to own NFTs with the same metadata.**
- **You want onchain differentiation of NFTs by their metadata.**
- **The NFT resembles categorical more than unique information.**
