<Note>
  Granting is still currently in beta. Please [schedule a
  call](https://calendly.com/symmtry/chat) if you would like to use grants in
  production and we can fast-track your onboarding.

### Granting vs. Minting

Granting enables you to permit an address to mint tokens on their own time and does not itself produce
a blockchain transaction. This makes granting free for your application as users will be paying with their
own gas at the time of mint, which can take place on your own interface or use a default experience provided
by Station.

When you grant an NFT, our cloud-wallets sign an approval for the recipient that is used to authenticate
their mint call within the smart contract. Each signature can optionally be set with an expiration as well.
