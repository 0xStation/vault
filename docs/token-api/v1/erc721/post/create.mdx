### How NFT creation works

NFTs are represented on the blockchain through a smart contract that manages the accounting of who owns which NFT.
To create a new NFT collection, we create a new smart contract designed to manage it and then are able to populate it with the actual tokens.
The smart contract is analogous to a spreadsheet, it is the home that defines the structure and content of the records.

This API route will take in parameters for creating a new NFT collection and return an address where this new smart contract is deployed.
This contract address uniquely identifies your NFT collection and will be used in other API routes.

### Body

<ParamField body="chainId" type="number" required>
  The id of the chain supporting the NFT. This cannot be changed after creation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the collection. This cannot be changed after creation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="symbol" type="string" required>
  The symbol of the collection. This cannot be changed after creation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transferable" type="boolean" default="true">
  `true` if tokens are freely transferable by recipients, `false` if tokens
  cannot be transfered by owners to other addresses. This does not impact the
  ability to mint tokens to an address or burn tokens from an address. This can
  be changed after creation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="defaultMetadata" type="object" optional>
  Default metadata to apply to every NFT in the collection, which can be
  overriden with token-specific metadata. This can be changed after creation.
  <Expandable title="NFT Metadata">
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      Name for the NFT.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="description" type="string" optional>
      Description for the NFT.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="mediaUrl" type="string" required>
      Url for the media content associated with the NFT.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="externalUrl" type="string" optional>
      Url for the external link associated with the NFT.

    <ParamField body="traits" type="Trait[]" optional>
      Array of trait objects.
