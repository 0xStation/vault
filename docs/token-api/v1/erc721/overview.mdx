For basic use cases, you may want to [set default metadata to apply to all NFTs](/token-api/v1/erc721/put/defaultMetadata).
This operation can also take place in the original creation API call.

Using the NFT contract address, you can [mint tokens to your network](/token-api/v1/erc721/post/mint).
Our blockchain indexing systems will automatically pick up these operations and organize the activity.

For dynamic use cases, you may want to [set individual metadata per-NFT](/token-api/v1/erc721/put/individualMetadata).
This operation can also take place in the original NFT mint API call.
