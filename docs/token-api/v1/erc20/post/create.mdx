### How token creation works

Tokens are represented on the blockchain through a smart contract that manages the accounting of how many
tokens each person owns. To create a new token collection, we create a new smart contract designed to manage
it and then are able to distribute tokens. The smart contract is analogous to a spreadsheet, it is the home
that defines the structure and content of the records.

This API route will take in parameters for creating a new token collection and return an address where this
new smart contract is deployed. This contract address uniquely identifies your token collection and will be
used in other API routes.

### Body
