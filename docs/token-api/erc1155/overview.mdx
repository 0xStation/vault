</Info>

To get started with a Badge system, [create a new collection](/token-api/erc1155/post/create).
Creating a collection will deploy a new token contract for you and return an address of this contract.

Using the NFT contract address, you can [update badge metadata](/token-api/erc1155/put/metadata) to prepare
the content of the NFT prior to minting it to your network.

Using the NFT contract address, you can [mint tokens to your network](/token-api/erc1155/post/mint).
Minted tokens will automatically be picked up by our indexing systems and organize the token into your network topology.

After distributing tokens to your network, you can [fetch all token holders of your token collections](/token-api/holders/holders)
for multi-token analysis.

<Note>All tokens are created on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/).</Note>
