<Info>
  Each proposal is a unit of portable and verifiable proof of work stored on
  IPFS. A proposalâ€™s metadata delineates the participating parties, timestamps,
  milestones, and payment history to maximize verifiability, accountability, and
  data interoperability.

Proposer brings a wallet-centric, multi-player, decentralized internet closer to reality. We built this product with individuals at the center and the magical ideas that form when they come together.
