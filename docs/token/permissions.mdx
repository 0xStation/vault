title: "Permissions"
description: "Granular and flexible logic upgrades."

Throughout a token’s lifespan, it needs to adapt to evolving requirements and goals. The core behavior
of a token, the logic that manages its production, transmutation, and destruction, must be designed
for mutability as a default to support the network’s changing needs.

Conventional approaches to realize this level of flexibility converges to the notion of “upgradeable”
contracts. Upgradeable contracts typically have one or more “implementation” contracts that are engaged
by a “proxy” contract which canonically represents “the token,” storing the actual state of the smart
contract (token ownership). Proxy patterns typically pair with designating a singular address, the “owner”,
as having the highest permissions to switch these implementation contracts, modifying a token’s logic.
While Station employs upgradeable proxy patterns and singular owners, following the [UUPS standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822)
, we devised a complimentary system responsible for the predictable needs of logic changes, increasing
specificity and flexibility, and reducing risk.

## Permissions

This specificity comes by differentiating the various interaction patterns tokens, and their administration,
follow. We call these different interaction patterns “operations” and they include the familiar **mint**,
**burn**, and **transfer** in addition to the ability to **upgrade** the token and change how to **render**
metadata if our token is an NFT. The ruleset of operations can be changed in isolation, providing confidence
that edits are clearly defined and not at risk of creating unexpected behavior.

Constructing the logic of an operation has two parts: (1) who has **access** to execute an operation and
(2) what **rules** apply uniformly to an operation regardless of who is making it.

### 1. Operation Access

A flexible access system enables multiple entities to control an operation and each entity to control multiple
operations. Both of these are implemented by one mapping of addresses to their permitted operations.

Associating permissions with addresses simultaneously supports multiple use patterns including, but not limited
to, individual administrators, automated cloud processes, and smart contract integrations. This is possible
because many entities can be identified by an address: personal wallets, group wallets, platform-owned wallets,
and any smart contract. This simplicity and universality make for a powerful abstraction, enabling the
supermajority of customization that groups need in a single design choice.

These stored permissions are enforced at the beginning of any function call that involves a given operation
by including a single solidity modifier `permitted(operation)`. For example, the mint function on our ERC-20
token standard looks like:

```solidity
function mintTo(address account, uint256 amount) external permitted(Operation.MINT) {
	// mint tokens...
}
```

Any address that attempts to mint this ERC-20 token will immediately be checked as having the permission by
this modifier and if not the execution terminates. Every function that applies some operation simply includes
the appropriate `permitted` modifier around it to manage access control.

### 2. Operation Rules

Regardless of which addresses are attempting operations, uniformly applied rules clearly define how token
ownership is constrained. The most popular rules used at time of writing enforce non-transferability, to avoid
legal complications or reduce risk of purchaseable authority, and max ownership of one token per holder, to
serve simple identity use cases. These additional conditions lay on top of whatever previous authentication
is performed by token operators, and help create consistency among parallel processes for token interactions.
For example, a smart contract that facilitates public token purchases and a trusted [Safe](https://safe.global/)
may both have the mint permission, but both operators are still required to mint tokens to recipients that do
not not already have a token if the max ownership rule is set.

Rules are currently only enforced on token ownership changes and applied by implementing a hook function
exposed by Open Zeppelin’s token implementations called `_afterTokenTransfer`. Whenever a token ownership
change attempt occurs (mint, burn, or transfer), this function is called, triggering our rule-checking process.

First, the rule for an operation is read from a mapping of operations to its rule address. Reading will
return one of three values: (1) the zero address i.e. no constraints set, (2) the max address i.e. absolute
constraint set, or (3) other address i.e. conditional constraits set. When no additional constraints are set
(zero address), the operation is free to continue as is and will complete the ownership change. When absolute
constraints are set (max address), the operation is prohibited from happening in all cases and rejects the
ownership change. When conditional constraints are set (other address), the address represents the location of
a “guard” contract to check if the ownership change is allowed.

Guards adhere to a token-specific interface and return `true` if the operation is allowed or `false` if not.
Below is an example implementation of applying rule checks on an ERC-721 token.

```solidity
// called at the end of executing internal _transfer function in token implementation
function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override {
    address guard;
    // mint
    if (from == address(0)) {
        guard = guardOf(Operation.MINT);
    }
    // burn
    else if (to == address(0)) {
        guard = guardOf(Operation.BURN);
    }
    // transfer
    else {
        guard = guardOf(Operation.TRANSFER);
    }

    require(
        // auto-reject if max address
        guard != MAX_ADDRESS && (
        // auto-pass if zero address
        guard == address(0) ||
        // check guard if other address
        ITokenGuard(guard).isAllowed(msg.sender, from, to, tokenId)),
        "GUARD_REJECTION"
    );
}
```

All together, the combination of upgradeable proxies, permitted operators, and guarded operations create an
intuitive and flexible token design. Our goal with GroupOS’s token standards is to create value systems that
groups can rely on using _for_ _life_ and we believe accomodating any unpredictable need is critical in
realizing that.
