Another path to extending the functionality of a token is through permitting cloud-managed wallets
to control some operations. While these wallets can’t embed logic within themselves like a smart
contract can, the offchain systems around them can abstract any logic for an onchain interaction.
And just like before, a token can permit any number of cloud-wallets and operate in parallel with
onchain modules.

The security of these cloud-wallets is paramount which is why we’ve partnered with [Turnkey](https://turnkey.io/)
to manage the private keys behind the scenes. Through Turnkey’s secure enclaves, Station’s offchain
infrastrucuture is able to request signing of arbitrary bytes data. Station exposes this functionality
to groups via a [Token API](/token-api/v1/intro) that standardizes the
common needs of controlling token behavior from offchain events.

The most popular patterns for API-control are in the production of new tokens, which can be done
through two methods: (1) **Minting** tokens directly to individuals and (2) **Granting** tokens for
individuals to mint themselves.

### 1. Minting Tokens

By “minting”, we refer to the act of putting _new_ data onchain: the ownership of a token that did not
exist before. Using an API to mint tokens to wallets is actively “pushing” the assets to their address,
which means your recipients don’t need to do anything to get them. This kind of distribution creates
premium experiences where users don’t need to worry about opening a mint page link, connecting their
wallet, and paying their own gas; users just see something new in their wallet and smile.

Imagine an incentivized open-source project where contributors automatically receive new badge NFTs for
each PR they merge. Imagine a network of marketers that receive points weekly depending on how much
additional distribution they generate for publised content. Imagine building token incentives into your
next application to reward and engage users.

The interface to enable this all is also ridiculously simple. Here’s an example of minting ERC-721 NFTs
where all we need to provide is a `chainId` for the token contract, paired with a `contractAddress` to
identity the token, and a `recipientAddress` to locate where to mint to:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request
curl 'https://members.station.express/api/v1/erc721/mint' \
--request POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--data-raw '{
    "chainId": 137,
    "contractAddress": "0x67F4732266C7300cca593C814d46bee72e40659F",
    "recipientAddress": "0xc517c83f417b73dA98647dad0FCB80af9f3b9531",
}'
```

```bash Response
{
	"transactionHash": "0x58c789b7a59312ec0a659e165700db54af896d3e8b46e4aeecb33b32b88157c9"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Behind the scenes, the offchain infrastructure is checking permissions for the call, requesting Turnkey
to sign a mint transaction, and publishing the transaction through an RPC provider. The transaction gas
cost is paid this cloud-wallet and our systems automatically replenish the balance of the network’s coin.
At the end of the month, transaction fees are rolled up into an invoice that can be paid in the same coin
or in fiat.

### 2. Granting Tokens

Compared to minting, granting does not produce a blockchain transaction and instead creates the permission
for someone else to do the “minting”. This offloads the burden of transacting from our infrastructure and
your application onto your users, which can take place on your own interface or on a Station-powered
experience.

Granting works by signing an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) object that encodes the
necessary parameters to prove permission to a smart contract, often one of our modules. Like when minting,
we need to know the `chainId`, `contractAddress`, and `recipientAddress` in addition to two new fields: a
`nonce` and an `expiration`. Nonces are a common solution to the [Signature Replay](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/signature-replay/)
attack by ensuring a grant signature can only be used once. Expiration is used to indicate when a grant
is no longer considered valid and can be set to `0` to indicate no expiration.

In the Station Membership mint experience, we use granting patterns to support offchain gating conditions
like passing a KYC check, or entering form information. We extend this ability to define your own conditions
and ping our systems when someone is eligible to mint.

curl 'https://members.station.express/api/v1/erc721/grant' \
--request POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
--data-raw '{
    "chainId": 137,
    "contractAddress": "0x67F4732266C7300cca593C814d46bee72e40659F",
    "recipientAddress": "0xc517c83f417b73dA98647dad0FCB80af9f3b9531",
}'
```

	"grantId": "5f2e491c-6fec-4324-a539-d9ba72ef261f",
	"signature": "0x58c789b7a59312ec0a659e165700db54af896d3e8b46e4aeecb33b32b88157c9"
	"nonce": 420,
	"expiration": null
}
